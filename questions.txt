Questions before building the app:

1. When music stops, do players stop exactly where they are, or animate to the nearest chair position?

2. How is "sitting" shown visually? Player circle on top of the chair, or overlapping it?

3. For even chairs/odd players case: how is the eliminated player determined? The one furthest from any chair?

4. After elimination, do remaining players return to sitting on chairs before the next round starts?

5. Any special visual effect for the winner at the end?

6. Preferred window size?
